            <p class="text-top">Greetings!</p>
            <p class="paragraph-top">Hey folks! This is me <b><i>Ayush Kumar </i></b>&lt;3! Well I guess some people are
                wondering
                about the new look of my website! Lol! But yeah! I have re-designed my whole website because the former
                one was
                looking very pathetic and unethical to be honest! :). But no worries as for now as it is live right now
                again! So!
                Lets begin! It's been a while I've been into the business of making stickers and GIFs and I've learned
                many things
                in the short duration of time! I've learned about my audience, what are the things they want to see and
                use them
                everywhere because they feel that the particular stickers and GIFs express their emotion and feelings at
                that of the
                particular moment! <br><br>

                As for me! I've started from 219 insights to 75,000+ insights of my stickers and many more to come! I've
                dreamt to reach
                a million sticker views and I'm working hard for it! It's not like that I'm a full time graphic designer
                I draw and
                paint stuff because it makes me feel who I am really! You should always remeber who you are and where
                you belong to!
                That would help you for being firmly attached to your ground! I checked my dashboard there was a sudden
                boom of
                insights! After a day or two of posting the Camel stickers I also got informed by the Giphy that it was
                the most engaged
                sticker when people searched of the word <b>Camel</b>.Since hearing that I've been pumped with
                motivation and looking
                forward to achieve more than ever!</p>
